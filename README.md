# Knucklebones

Our game is a replication of "Knucklebones" which is a mini-game inside the video game "Cult of the Lamb"

## Files

knucklebones.py is the main program where the game's code is written
test.py is a test file that we used to test using github

## How to Run

In the terminal, navigate to the Final_Project folder and then type python .\knucklebones.py

## How to Play

Knucklebones is a game based on the luck of dice and strategy. There are two boards, each with three columns and three rows. The goal of the game is to end with the highest total score of dice values in your board.
