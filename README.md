# Knucklebones

Our game is a replication of "Knucklebones" which is a mini-game inside the video game "Cult of the Lamb"

## Files

knucklebones.py is the main program where the game's code is written
test.py is a test file that we used to test using github
Bibliography.pdf is the pdf which is the bibliography of our sources

## How to Run

In the terminal, navigate to the Final_Project folder and then type python .\knucklebones.py

## How to Play

Knucklebones is a game based on luck and strategy. There are two boards, each with three columns and three rows. Players will roll a six-sided die and then place that die into the one of three columns. The score of dice on the board multiplies if the same value dice are in the same column. Players can delete opponents dice by placing dice of the same value in the enemys' corresponding column. The goal of the game is to end with the highest total score of dice values in your board.

The program will display both boards and then roll a die. It will ask you to input a column (1, 2, or 3) to place that die in. Then, the computer will roll a die and place a die into its own board. The game ends when either board gets filled and whichever board has a higher score wins.
